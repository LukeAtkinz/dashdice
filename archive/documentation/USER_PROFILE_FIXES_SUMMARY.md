# User Profile System Fixes and Enhancements

## Summary of Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed UserProfileViewer Date Error
**Issue:** `TypeError: _userProfile_createdAt.toLocaleDateString is not a function`

**Solution:** Updated date handling in UserProfileViewer to properly handle Firestore Timestamp objects:
```tsx
// Before: userProfile.createdAt?.toLocaleDateString()
// After: userProfile.createdAt?.toDate?.() ? userProfile.createdAt.toDate().toLocaleDateString() : 'Unknown'
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/profile/UserProfileViewer.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Added "Add Friend" Button to User Profile Viewer
**Feature:** Added a prominent "Add Friend" button in the top-right of user profile containers.

**Implementation Details:**
- Button only appears for non-friend users (not already friends or own profile)
- Automatically sends friend request without requiring friend codes
- Shows loading state while sending request
- Shows "✓ Friends" badge for existing friends
- Integrated with existing Friends context and services

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/profile/UserProfileViewer.tsx`

**Key Features:**
- Smart visibility logic (hidden for own profile and existing friends)
- Loading states and error handling
- Consistent styling with existing UI components
- Direct integration with friend request system

### 3. ✅ Fixed Component Scrolling Issues
**Issues:** Users could scroll the entire page in Friends, Inventory, and Ranked components instead of just scrollable containers.

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### A. Friends Dashboard
- **Before:** Main container had `overflow-y-auto` allowing page scrolling
- **After:** Changed to `overflow-hidden` - only internal containers (friend cards, etc.) can scroll

#### B. Ranked Dashboard  
- **Before:** Main container had `overflow-y-auto` allowing page scrolling
- **After:** Changed to `overflow-hidden` - only internal containers scroll

#### C. Inventory Dashboard
- **Status:** Already correctly implemented - main container uses `overflow-hidden` with only item selectors scrollable

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/friends/FriendsDashboard.tsx`
- `src/components/ranked/RankedDashboard.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Fixed Mobile Scrolling for Match/Waiting Room/Game Over
**Issues:** Mobile users could scroll content during matches, waiting rooms, and game over screens.

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### A. CSS-Based Mobile Scrolling Control
Added comprehensive CSS rules in `globals.css`:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Disable scrolling on match, waiting room, and game over screens */
  .match-container, 
  .waiting-room-container, 
  .game-over-container {
    overflow: hidden !important;
    touch-action: none !important;
    position: fixed !important;
    width: 100vw !important;
    height: 100vh !important;
  }
  
  /* Ensure body doesn't scroll on these screens */
  body.match-active,
  body.waiting-room-active,
  body.game-over-active {
    overflow: hidden !important;
    touch-action: none !important;
    position: fixed !important;
  }
  
  /* Keep leave match button accessible */
  .leave-match-button {
    position: fixed !important;
    z-index: 9999 !important;
    touch-action: auto !important;
  }
}
```

#### B. Component Class Management
Added CSS classes and body class management:

**Match Component:**
- Added `match-container` class to main container
- Added `game-over-container` class to game over overlay
- Added `useEffect` to manage `match-active` and `game-over-active` body classes

**Game Waiting Room:**
- Added `waiting-room-container` class to main container  
- Added `useEffect` to manage `waiting-room-active` body class

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/components/dashboard/Match.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/GameWaitingRoom.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Mobile Scrolling Strategy
1. **Container-Level Control:** Added specific CSS classes to match/waiting room containers
2. **Body-Level Control:** Dynamic body class management prevents document scrolling
3. **Accessibility Preserved:** Leave match button remains accessible with higher z-index
4. **Touch Action Control:** Uses `touch-action: none` to prevent swipe gestures

### Friend Request Integration
1. **Context Integration:** Uses existing `useFriends` context for friend operations
2. **State Management:** Proper loading states and error handling
3. **UI Logic:** Smart button visibility based on relationship status
4. **User Experience:** Immediate visual feedback for actions

### Scrolling Architecture
1. **Component Isolation:** Each dashboard component controls its own scrolling
2. **Container Hierarchy:** Main containers prevent scrolling, internal containers allow it
3. **Mobile Optimization:** Special mobile-only CSS rules for better touch experience
4. **Performance:** Minimal impact on existing scrolling functionality

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ User Profile Viewer
- [x] Profile loads without date errors
- [x] Add Friend button appears for non-friends
- [x] Add Friend button hidden for existing friends
- [x] Add Friend button hidden for own profile
- [x] Friend request sends successfully
- [x] Loading states work properly

### ✅ Component Scrolling
- [x] Friends dashboard: no page scroll, friend cards scroll
- [x] Inventory dashboard: no page scroll, item containers scroll  
- [x] Ranked dashboard: no page scroll, internal content scrolls

### ✅ Mobile Match Scrolling
- [x] Match screen: no scrolling of main content
- [x] Waiting room: no scrolling of main content
- [x] Game over screen: no scrolling
- [x] Leave match button remains accessible
- [x] Desktop functionality unaffected

## Browser Compatibility

### Mobile Support
- **iOS Safari:** `touch-action` and `webkit-overflow-scrolling` properties
- **Android Chrome:** Standard touch and overflow properties
- **Mobile Edge:** Full compatibility with CSS touch controls

### Desktop Support
- **All Modern Browsers:** Standard CSS overflow and positioning properties
- **No Breaking Changes:** Desktop experience preserved entirely

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Performance Cost
- **CSS Rules:** Mobile-only media queries with minimal overhead
- **JavaScript:** Simple class addition/removal on component mount/unmount
- **Memory:** No additional memory overhead
- **Rendering:** No impact on rendering performance

## Security Considerations

### Friend Request Security
- **Authentication:** Uses existing auth context for user verification
- **Authorization:** Friend request service handles permissions
- **Input Validation:** User ID validation through existing services
- **Rate Limiting:** Handled by existing friend request system

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### User Profile Viewer
1. **Cache Profiles:** Cache frequently viewed profiles for performance
2. **Real-time Status:** Show live online/offline status
3. **Recent Activity:** Display recent games/achievements
4. **Profile Sharing:** Generate shareable profile links

### Mobile Experience
1. **Gesture Controls:** Add swipe gestures for navigation
2. **Haptic Feedback:** Add vibration feedback for actions
3. **Orientation Lock:** Lock orientation during matches

## Conclusion

All requested fixes have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Date Error Fixed:** UserProfileViewer now properly handles Firestore timestamps
2. ✅ **Add Friend Button:** Functional friend request system integrated into profile viewer
3. ✅ **Component Scrolling:** Friends, Inventory, and Ranked components now only allow container-level scrolling
4. ✅ **Mobile Match Scrolling:** Complete mobile scrolling prevention for match/waiting room/game over screens

The implementation maintains backward compatibility, preserves desktop functionality, and provides enhanced mobile experience while following existing code patterns and performance standards.
