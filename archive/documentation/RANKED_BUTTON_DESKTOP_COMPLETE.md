# Ranked Button Added to Desktop Navigation ‚úÖ

## Summary
Successfully added the RANKED button to the desktop navigation bar in the main SinglePageDashboard component.

## Problem
The ranked button was missing from the desktop navigation, even though:
- Ranked functionality was fully implemented
- The ranked section existed in NavigationContext
- Mobile navigation included the ranked button
- The `DashboardNavigation.tsx` component had the ranked button, but it wasn't being used on the main dashboard

## Root Cause
The main dashboard (`SinglePageDashboard.tsx`) has its own custom navigation implementation instead of using the `DashboardNavigation.tsx` component. The desktop navigation only included VAULT and FRIENDS buttons, missing the RANKED button.

## Solution Implemented

### Added RANKED Button to Desktop Navigation
**File Modified**: `src/components/layout/SinglePageDashboard.tsx`

**Button Features**:
- **Golden Theme**: Uses `#FFD700` background color with gradient variations
- **Trophy Icon**: üèÜ emoji with proper sizing (40px √ó 40px)
- **Disabled State**: Grayed out during matches (consistent with other buttons)
- **Hover Effects**: Scale and translate animations on hover
- **Background Adaptation**: Different gradients for special backgrounds (On A Mission, Long Road Ahead)
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the existing VAULT and FRIENDS button design patterns

**Button Styling**:
```tsx
// Golden gradient background
background: "#FFD700"
// Special backgrounds get custom gradients
// Proper backdrop blur for certain backgrounds
// Audiowide font family consistent with other buttons
// 180px width √ó 48px height (standard size)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Button Positioning
- Positioned between FRIENDS and SHOP (disabled) buttons
- Added to the desktop navigation section (`hidden md:flex`)
- Uses the same `handleSectionChange('ranked')` function as other navigation buttons

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full RANKED button with trophy icon and text
- **Mobile**: Already existed in mobile navigation (üèÜ RANKED)
- **Disabled State**: Consistent behavior during matches

### Visual Design
- **Primary Color**: Gold (`#FFD700`) to represent competitive/premium nature
- **Icon**: Trophy emoji (üèÜ) - universally recognized symbol for rankings
- **Typography**: Audiowide font, 22px size, white color
- **Animations**: Hover scale (1.05) and translate (-1px) effects
