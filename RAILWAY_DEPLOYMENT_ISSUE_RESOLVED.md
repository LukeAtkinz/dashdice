# Railway Backend Deployment Issue - RESOLVED

## üö® Issue Identified
**Date**: September 24, 2025  
**Status**: RESOLVED (Temporary Fix Applied)

### Problem
The Railway deployment at `https://dashdice-production.up.railway.app` is serving the **Next.js frontend** instead of the **Go backend API**. This causes all API calls to return HTML instead of JSON, resulting in:

```
[Proxy] Go backend returned HTML instead of JSON: {
  status: 404,
  contentType: 'text/html; charset=utf-8',
  textPreview: '<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">...'
}
```

### Root Cause
**Railway Configuration Mismatch**: The main repository's `railway.toml` file is configured to deploy the Next.js frontend:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"

[start] 
  command = "npm run start"
  
[services.main]
  port = 3000  # Next.js port, not Go backend port 8080
```

**Expected**: Railway should deploy the Go services from `/go-services/` directory with its own `Dockerfile` and `railway.toml`.

**Actual**: Railway is deploying the root directory's Next.js application.

## ‚úÖ Temporary Fix Applied

### Solution
Added environment variable to disable Go backend and force Firebase fallback:

```bash
# In .env.local
DISABLE_GO_BACKEND=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_GO_BACKEND=true
```

### Code Changes
1. **GoBackendAdapter.ts**: Added check for `DISABLE_GO_BACKEND` environment variable
2. **Environment**: Commented out Railway URLs to prevent API calls
3. **Fallback**: All match search now uses Firebase/MatchmakingOrchestrator

### Result
- ‚úÖ Match search errors eliminated
- ‚úÖ Application works with Firebase fallback
- ‚úÖ No more HTML-instead-of-JSON errors
- ‚úÖ User experience restored

## üîß Permanent Fix Required

### Action Needed
**Deploy Go Backend Correctly to Railway**:

1. **Option A**: Configure Railway to deploy from `/go-services/` directory
2. **Option B**: Create separate Railway project for Go backend
3. **Option C**: Use different URL/domain for Go backend

### Railway Deployment Commands
```bash
cd go-services/
railway up
```

### Expected Go Backend URL
Once properly deployed, should return JSON:
```bash
curl https://dashdice-production.up.railway.app/health
# Should return: {"status": "ok", "service": "api-gateway"}
```

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Match search completely broken
- ‚ùå Console errors flooding browser
- ‚ùå 503 errors on all API calls
- ‚ùå User cannot start games

### After Fix  
- ‚úÖ Match search working via Firebase
- ‚úÖ Clean error handling
- ‚úÖ Users can start games normally
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation implemented

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix applied - application working
2. **Short-term**: Configure Railway deployment correctly
3. **Long-term**: Test Go backend deployment thoroughly
4. **Monitor**: Ensure both Go backend AND Firebase fallback work

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Application working with Firebase fallback  
**Priority**: Medium (for Go backend re-deployment)  
**User Impact**: None (transparent fallback working)
