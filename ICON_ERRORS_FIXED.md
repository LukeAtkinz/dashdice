# 🔧 Icon Load Errors - FIXED

## 🐛 Issues Found:
- PWA manifest.json had incorrect icon paths (`../icons/` instead of `/icons/`)
- Icons were in wrong directory (not accessible from web)
- Incorrect MIME types (listed as PNG but files were WebP)
- Missing icon files in public directory

## ✅ Solutions Applied:

### 1. Fixed Manifest.json Icon Paths
**Before:**
```json
"src": "../icons/icon-192.webp"
```

**After:**
```json
"src": "/icons/icon-192.webp"
```

### 2. Moved Icons to Correct Location
- **Created:** `public/icons/` directory
- **Copied:** All icons from `icons/` to `public/icons/`
- **Result:** Icons now accessible at `/icons/` URL path

### 3. Fixed MIME Types
**Before:**
```json
"type": "image/png"
```

**After:**
```json
"type": "image/webp"
```

### 4. Updated Layout.tsx Icon References
- Added multiple icon sizes for better PWA support
- Included WebP icons for modern browsers
- Added Apple Touch Icons for iOS devices

## 📱 Available Icons Now:
