# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Fix

### **Problem:** 
Railway failing with React/Expo dependency conflicts during `npm ci`

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Created `railway.toml`** - Forces `--legacy-peer-deps` during install
2. **Created `.railwayignore`** - Excludes problematic Expo files
3. **Configured custom build commands**

### **Files Added:**
```toml
# railway.toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[build.nixpacksConfig]
installCommand = "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
buildCommand = "npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
```

### **Alternative Solutions if Still Failing:**

#### **Option 1: Environment Variables**
Add to Railway dashboard:
- `NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS=true`
- `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`

#### **Option 2: Use Vercel Instead**
Since Vercel is working perfectly:
- Your app is already live at: https://dashdice-1dib-lmwq4amif-dash-dice.vercel.app
- Vercel handles Next.js better than Railway
- No need for Railway if Vercel works

#### **Option 3: Separate the Go Services**
If Railway is specifically for Go backend:
- Deploy Next.js app on Vercel (âœ… Working)
- Deploy Go services separately on Railway
- Update environment variables to point between services

### **Recommendation:**
**Stick with Vercel for the main app** - it's working perfectly and is more reliable for Next.js deployments.

Use Railway only if you specifically need it for the Go backend services.
