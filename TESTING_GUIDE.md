# ðŸ§ª Match System Testing Guide

## ðŸŽ® How to Test the Match System

### **Starting a Test Match:**
1. **Click the "TEST MATCH" button** (formerly SHOP button) in the dashboard
2. **System automatically creates:**
   - 2 test players with random backgrounds and stats
   - An active match in the 'gameplay' phase
   - Real Firebase documents for testing

### **What You Can Test:**
âœ… **Real-time match interface** with live Firebase data  
âœ… **Slot machine dice animations** with progressive deceleration  
âœ… **Complete game rules:**
- Single 1: Turn over, no score added
- Double 6: Player score reset to 0  
- Snake Eyes (Double 1): +20 to turn score, continue
- Normal scoring: Add dice sum to turn score

âœ… **Banking system** to convert turn score to player score  
âœ… **Turn management** and player switching  
âœ… **Win conditions** when reaching round objective  
âœ… **Dynamic backgrounds** from test player data  

### **Test Player Details:**
- **TestPlayer1** (YOU control): Classic mode, "All For Glory" background
- **TestPlayer2** (Opponent): Various backgrounds, realistic stats
- **Round Objective:** 100 points (Classic mode)
- **Starting Scores:** TestPlayer1: 25, TestPlayer2: 18

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Commands

### **Browser Console Commands:**
```javascript
// Delete all test data
testUtils.deleteTestPlayers()

// Check how many test matches exist  
testUtils.checkTestMatches()

// Full cleanup with summary
testUtils.cleanupAndCheck()
```

### **When You Say "Delete Test Players":**
Run this command in browser console:
```javascript
testUtils.deleteTestPlayers()
```

**This will:**
- âœ… Delete ALL test matches from Firebase
- âœ… Delete ALL test waiting room entries  
- âœ… Clean up completely without affecting real data
- âœ… Safe and reversible (just click TEST MATCH again)
