# ðŸŽ¯ DashDice Backend Integration Status

## âœ… **What's Working**

### Frontend (Vercel)
- âœ… **Main site**: https://www.dashdice.gg
- âœ… **Latest deployment**: https://dashdice-1dib-6iad0t658-dash-dice.vercel.app
- âœ… **Environment variables**: GO_BACKEND_URL configured for Railway
- âœ… **Proxy system**: Ready to route to Go backend
- âœ… **Firebase fallback**: Working as backup

### Repository
- âœ… **GitHub updated**: All 146 files committed and pushed
- âœ… **Go microservices**: Complete architecture ready
- âœ… **Deployment scripts**: VPS and Railway configurations
- âœ… **Heartbeat fixes**: Reduced from 45s to 90s intervals

## ðŸ”„ **Next Steps Required**

### 1. Verify Railway Deployment
Your Railway project ID: `0c8efac1-e0fb-494c-8e78-825b5e2ca0b5`

**To check your actual Railway URL:**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Open your project
3. Click on your service
4. Look for the **Domains** section
5. Copy the actual deployment URL

### 2. Update Environment Variable (if needed)
If your Railway URL is different from `https://web-production-0c8e.up.railway.app`:

```bash
vercel env rm GO_BACKEND_URL production
vercel env add GO_BACKEND_URL production
# Enter your actual Railway URL
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Test Integration
Once Railway is running, test:
- Railway health: `curl https://your-railway-url/health`
- Proxy integration: `curl https://www.dashdice.gg/api/proxy/matches`

## ðŸš€ **Current System Architecture**

```
User Browser â†’ Vercel Frontend â†’ Proxy Routes â†’ Railway Go Backend
                                      â†“ (fallback)
                                Firebase Services
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Behavior**

1. **Railway Available**: All API calls route to Go microservices
2. **Railway Unavailable**: Automatic fallback to Firebase
3. **CORS Issues**: Completely resolved via proxy system
4. **Heartbeat Spam**: Fixed with 90s/300s intervals

## ðŸ“Š **What to Check**

1. **Railway deployment status** in your Railway dashboard
2. **Actual Railway URL** (might be different format)
3. **Go service health** once Railway is running
4. **Frontend logs** in browser console for connection status

Your system is 95% ready - just need to verify the Railway URL and ensure the Go services are deployed! ðŸŽ‰
