# ðŸ¤– DashDice Bot System Documentation

## Overview
The DashDice Bot System provides intelligent AI opponents that seamlessly integrate into the matchmaking system. When a user searches for a game and no human opponent is found within 7 seconds, the system automatically matches them with a suitable bot opponent.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Bot Types & Interfaces** (`src/types/bot.ts`)
   - `BotProfile`: Complete bot definition with personality, stats, and strategy
   - `BotPersonality`: Detailed personality metrics that drive AI behavior
   - `BotStrategy`: Strategic patterns and decision-making rules
   - `BotDecision`: AI decision context and reasoning

2. **Bot Matching Service** (`src/services/botMatchingService.ts`)
   - Handles bot selection and matchmaking
   - Manages 7-second fallback timer
   - Integrates with both Firebase and Go backend sessions

3. **Bot AI Service** (`src/services/botAIService.ts`)
   - Intelligent gameplay decision-making
   - Personality-driven behavior simulation
   - Adaptive strategies based on game context

4. **Bot Profile Generator** (`src/utils/botProfileGenerator.ts`)
   - Generates diverse bot profiles for database population
   - Creates realistic personality distributions
   - Ensures balanced difficulty progression

## Bot Personality System

### Personality Metrics (0.0 - 1.0 scale)

- **Aggressiveness**: Tendency to take risks and continue rolling
- **Banking Tendency**: Preference for securing points early
- **Risk Tolerance**: Willingness to accept potential losses
- **Adaptation Speed**: How quickly bot adjusts to opponent strategies
- **Emotional Volatility**: Tendency for emotional decision-making
- **Pressure Resistance**: Performance under high-stakes situations
- **Momentum Awareness**: Recognition of game flow and timing
- **Tilt Resistance**: Ability to maintain composure after losses

### Bot Archetypes

1. **Conservative** (25% aggressiveness, 80% banking tendency)
   - Banks early and often
   - Avoids risky situations
   - Steady, predictable gameplay
   - High pressure resistance

2. **Aggressive** (75% aggressiveness, 25% banking tendency)
   - Takes high risks for high rewards
   - Continues rolling longer
   - Applies pressure on opponents
   - Higher emotional volatility

3. **Balanced** (50% all metrics with high adaptation)
   - Adapts to opponent strategies
   - Flexible tactical approach
   - Well-rounded performance
   - Situational decision-making

4. **Chaotic** (High volatility and unpredictability)
   - Unpredictable banking patterns
   - Emotional decision-making
   - Creates psychological pressure
   - Momentum-based play style

5. **Strategic** (High awareness and adaptation)
   - Analyzes opponent patterns
   - Calculated risk assessment
   - Counter-strategy development
   - Pattern recognition expertise

### Skill Levels

- **Beginner** (ELO: 1000Â±200)
  - Basic decision-making
  - Lower adaptation speed
  - Simpler strategic patterns

- **Intermediate** (ELO: 1300Â±200)
  - Improved risk assessment
  - Better pattern recognition
  - More consistent performance

- **Advanced** (ELO: 1600Â±200)
  - Sophisticated strategies
  - High adaptation ability
  - Strong pressure resistance

- **Expert** (ELO: 1900Â±200)
  - Master-level decision-making
  - Elite pattern recognition
  - Exceptional consistency

## Matchmaking Integration

### 7-Second Fallback System

When a user creates a new game session:

1. **Immediate Search**: System searches for human opponents
2. **Session Creation**: If no opponent found, creates new session
3. **Bot Timer**: Automatically starts 7-second countdown
4. **Bot Matching**: After timeout, finds suitable bot opponent
5. **Seamless Integration**: Bot joins session like a human player

### Bot Selection Algorithm

1. **Game Mode Compatibility**: Bot must support the selected game mode
2. **Skill-Based Matching**: Prioritizes bots with similar ELO (Â±300 for ranked)
3. **Personality Fit**: Considers archetype appropriateness for game type
4. **Activity Simulation**: Factors in simulated "recent activity"
5. **Difficulty Adjustment**: Ensures balanced challenge level

## AI Decision-Making

### Banking Decision Logic

```typescript
// Simplified decision flow
const shouldBank = (turnScore: number, gameContext: GameContext) => {
  const threshold = calculateBankingThreshold(bot.personality, gameContext);
  const riskFactor = assessRiskLevel(gameContext, bot.personality);
  const emotionalState = simulateEmotionalState(bot, gameContext);
  
  return (turnScore >= threshold) && (riskFactor < bot.personality.riskTolerance);
};
```

### Context Awareness

- **Game Phase**: Early/Mid/Late game adjustments
- **Score Differential**: Aggressive play when behind, conservative when ahead
- **Opponent Analysis**: Adapts to human player patterns
- **Emotional Simulation**: Accounts for pressure and momentum

**Poor Bot Performance**
- Review personality calibration in generator
- Check AI decision thresholds in BotAIService
- Validate ELO distribution across skill levels

**Matchmaking Failures**
- Verify bot fallback timer setup
- Check session integration points
- Review error logs in BotMatchingService

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test bot system
npm run test-bots

# Reinitialize bots
npm run clear-bots && npm run init-bots

# Check Firebase connection
node -e "console.log('Firebase test:', require('firebase-admin').apps.length)"
```

## Security Considerations

### Bot Account Protection
- Bot profiles use dedicated email domain (`@dashdice.bot`)
- Bots cannot be modified by client applications
- Admin SDK required for bot management

### Anti-Cheat Integration
- Bots clearly identified in game sessions
- Bot behavior monitored for consistency
- Human players informed when matched with bots

### Privacy Compliance
- Bot data separate from user data
- No personal information in bot profiles
- GDPR compliant data handling

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Initialize the bot system:**
   ```bash
   npm run init-bots
   ```

2. **Test the system:**
   ```bash
   npm run test-bots
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
