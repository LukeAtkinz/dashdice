## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### New Components Created:
- `GameInvitationNotification.tsx` - Real-time notification popups
- `ToastContext.tsx` - User feedback system

### Updated Services:
- `gameInvitationService.ts` - Re-enabled and improved
- `FriendCard.tsx` - Added toast notifications and error handling

### Database Structure:
```
gameInvitations/
├── fromUserId: string
├── toUserId: string  
├── fromUserName: string
├── gameType: string
├── status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'declined' | 'expired'
├── createdAt: Timestamp
├── expiresAt: Timestamp (5 minutes)
└── gameSettings: object
```

### Firestore Rules Added:
```javascript
match /gameInvitations/{invitationId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    (request.auth.uid == resource.data.fromUserId || 
     request.auth.uid == resource.data.toUserId);
}
```

## 🚀 Testing the System

### Prerequisites:
1. Have at least 2 user accounts
2. Both users should be friends
3. Both users should be online

### Test Flow:
1. **User A**: Go to Friends → Find User B → Click INVITE → Select game mode
2. **User B**: Should see notification popup in top-right corner
3. **User B**: Click ACCEPT
4. **Both Users**: Should be taken to waiting room, then to match

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Invitation sent successfully (toast notification)
- ✅ Real-time notification appears for recipient
- ✅ Countdown timer shows time remaining
- ✅ Accept creates waiting room and match
- ✅ Decline removes invitation
- ✅ Expired invitations auto-cleanup

## 🔍 Debugging Information

### Console Logs to Watch:
- `✅ Game invitation sent successfully`
- `✅ GameInvitationService: Friend game moved to matches automatically`
- `🔄 RematchContext: Unsubscribing from rematch notifications`

### Common Issues:
1. **No notification appears**: Check if users are friends and online
2. **Invitation fails**: Check Firestore rules and user permissions
3. **Can't accept**: Verify invitation hasn't expired (5 minutes)

## 📱 User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback:
- Loading states during invitation sending
- Success/error toast notifications
- Real-time countdown timers
- Animated notification popups

### Error Handling:
- Invalid friend data validation

2. **Invitation History**: Track sent/received invitations
3. **Custom Messages**: Allow personal messages with invitations
4. **Group Invitations**: Support multi-player game invitations
5. **Invitation Queue**: Handle multiple pending invitations
