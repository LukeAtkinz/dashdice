## üñ•Ô∏è **MacinCloud Session Steps**

### **Session 1: Environment Setup (15 minutes)**

#### **1. Connect to MacinCloud:**
- Use Remote Desktop app
- Login with your MacinCloud credentials
- You'll see macOS desktop

**üñ•Ô∏è What You'll See:**
- macOS desktop with dock at bottom
- Finder icon, Safari, Terminal app
- Similar to Windows but with different styling
- Apple menu in top-left corner

**‚ö†Ô∏è MacinCloud Permission Issues:**
If you encounter "Need sudo access" errors:
1. **Contact MacinCloud Support** - Ask for administrator access
2. **Check your plan** - Some basic plans don't include admin rights
3. **Use workarounds** - See alternative installation methods below

#### **2. Install Required Tools:**

**üîß Step-by-Step Terminal Commands:**

**First, open Terminal on Mac:**
- Press `‚åò + Space` (Spotlight search)
- Type "Terminal" and press Enter
- You'll see a black window with a cursor

**Install Homebrew (Mac package manager):**

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you get "Need sudo access" error, try these alternatives:**

**Option 1: Install Homebrew without sudo (Recommended):**
```bash
# Install Homebrew to your home directory (no sudo needed):
git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew ~/.homebrew
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Option 2: Use pre-installed tools:**
```bash
# Check if Node.js is already installed:
which node
node --version

# If Node.js is already available, skip Homebrew and go directly to:
npm install -g @capacitor/cli
```

**Option 3: Contact MacinCloud Support:**
```bash
# If neither works, contact MacinCloud support and ask for:
# "Administrator access to install development tools"
# Most development plans include this
```

**Original method (if you have sudo access):**
```bash
# Copy and paste this ENTIRE line into Terminal:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
**What you'll see:**
- Terminal will download and install Homebrew (2-3 minutes)
- You'll see lots of text scrolling
- It may ask for your Mac password - type it (you won't see dots)
- Press Enter when prompted

**Install Node.js and Git:**

**üîç First, check what's already installed:**
```bash
# Check if Node.js is pre-installed:
which node
node --version

# Check if Git is pre-installed:
which git
git --version
```

**If tools are already installed, skip to Capacitor install. Otherwise:**

**Option 1: Using Homebrew (if installed successfully):**
```bash
# After Homebrew finishes, run:
~/.homebrew/bin/brew install node git
```

**Option 2: Download directly (no sudo needed):**
```bash
# Download Node.js manually:
curl -o node.tar.gz https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.17.0/node-v18.17.0-darwin-x64.tar.gz
tar -xzf node.tar.gz
export PATH="$PWD/node-v18.17.0-darwin-x64/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/node-v18.17.0-darwin-x64/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Option 3: Use MacinCloud pre-installed tools:**
```bash
# Many MacinCloud instances have development tools pre-installed
# Try these paths:
/usr/local/bin/node --version
/usr/bin/git --version
```
**What you'll see:**
- "Installing node..." and "Installing git..." messages
- Takes about 2-3 minutes
- Ends with "‚úÖ node was successfully installed!"

**Install Capacitor CLI:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you get "EACCES: permission denied" error, use local installation:**

**Option 1: Install Capacitor locally (Recommended for MacinCloud):**
```bash
# Skip global install, we'll use npx instead
# This avoids permission issues completely
echo "‚úÖ Node.js is ready, we'll use npx for Capacitor"
```

**Option 2: If you want global install (requires admin):**
```bash
# Finally, install Capacitor:
npm install -g @capacitor/cli
```

**What you'll see:**
- Downloads and installs Capacitor tools
- Takes about 30 seconds
- Shows version number when complete

**Note:** We can use `npx @capacitor/cli` instead of global install!

#### **3. Clone Your Project:**

**üóÇÔ∏è Step-by-Step Project Setup:**

**Navigate to Desktop:**
```bash
# Go to Desktop folder:
cd Desktop
```
**What happens:** Your terminal prompt changes to show `~/Desktop`

**Clone your DashDice project:**
```bash
# Download your project from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/LukeAtkinz/dashdice.git
```
**What you'll see:**
- "Cloning into 'dashdice'..." message
- Progress: "Receiving objects: 100%"
- Takes about 10-15 seconds
- Creates a "dashdice" folder on Desktop

**Enter the project folder:**
```bash
# Go into your project:
cd dashdice
```
**What happens:** Your prompt changes to `~/Desktop/dashdice`

**Install project dependencies:**
```bash
# Install all the packages your app needs:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
**What you'll see:**
- "Installing dependencies..." message
- Lots of package names scrolling by
- Progress bars for downloads
- Takes 2-3 minutes
- Ends with "added 2000+ packages"
- **Important:** This should work now because of our .npmrc fix!

#### **4. Open in Xcode:**

**üçé Launch Xcode with Your Project:**

**Open your iOS project in Xcode:**
```bash
# Use npx to run Capacitor without global install:
npx @capacitor/cli open ios
```

**Alternative if above doesn't work:**
```bash
# If npx @capacitor/cli doesn't work, try:
cd ios/App
open App.xcworkspace
```

**üö® If Xcode Opens but Shows No Project Files:**

This is a common issue! The problem is that the Capacitor iOS project needs to be properly synced first.

**Solution - Run these commands in Terminal:**
```bash
# First, make sure you're in the main project directory:
cd ~/Desktop/dashdice

# Sync the Capacitor project (this copies your web app to iOS):
npx @capacitor/cli sync ios

# Now open the iOS project:
npx @capacitor/cli open ios
```

**Manual Alternative:**
```bash
# If the above doesn't work, do it step by step:
cd ~/Desktop/dashdice

# Build your web app first:
npm run build

# Then sync to iOS:
npx @capacitor/cli sync ios

# Finally open in Xcode:
cd ios/App
open App.xcworkspace
```

**What `npx cap sync ios` does:**
- Copies your built web app to the iOS project
- Updates iOS project configuration
- Ensures all plugins are properly linked
- Creates the proper project structure for Xcode

**What you'll see:**
- Terminal shows "Opening Xcode workspace..."
- Xcode application launches (big blue icon)
- Takes 10-15 seconds to load
- Xcode opens with your DashDice project loaded
- You'll see file navigator on left side
- Main area shows your iOS project structure

**Visual Confirmation:**
- ‚úÖ **Xcode window title**: "App.xcworkspace"
- ‚úÖ **Left sidebar**: Shows "App" project with folders
- ‚úÖ **File navigator**: Contains your iOS app files
- ‚úÖ **No errors**: Blue "Run" button should be visible

**üéØ At This Point:**
- Your DashDice project is fully loaded in Xcode
- All dependencies are installed
- Ready to add app icons and configure signing
- Ready to test in iOS Simulator

**Next you'll:**
1. **Add your app icons** (drag from Desktop folder)
2. **Configure Apple Developer signing**
3. **Test in iPhone simulator**
4. **Archive and submit to App Store**
